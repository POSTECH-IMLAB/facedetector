POSTECH IM face detector

The IMLab face detector consists of background rejector, pose classifier, pose-specific face detectors, and face validator.The background rejector removes non-face patches quickly, the pose classifier estimates poses of the surviving patches, one or more selected pose-specific face detectors according to their estimated pose labels determines that a given patch is a face by using WTA strategy, and the face validator checks whether the face-like patch is really a face.For achieving strong discrimination power with low computing overhead, we devise several types of order relation features (ORF) that encode the order relation among feature elements as a unique code.The devised ORFs are placed in functional components appropriately to ensure fast operation of the multi-view face detector.For accurate classification, we propose a doubly domain-partitioning classifier that consists of a coarse domain-partitioning weak classifierfollowed by a fine bin-partitioning weighted linear discriminant analysis (wLDA) classifier.For fast classification, we devise a feature-sharing method that shares identical features between the background rejector and the pose classifier, and among all classes in the pose classifier.We evaluated the proposed multi-view face detector using the FDDB, AFW, and PASCAL face datasets.The experimental results show that the proposed multi-view face detector shows competitive results compared to other state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and execution time.
